The fifth planet was very curious. He was the smallest of
all, since there was barely room for a lantern and the lamplighter who
he lived The little prince could not explain why
They would serve there, in heaven, on a planet without houses and without
population a lantern and a lamplighter. However, it was said to himself
same:
This man, perhaps, is absurd. However, it is less
absurd that the king, the vain man, the businessman and the
drinker. His work, at least, makes sense. When
turn on your lantern, it's the same as if you made a star born
more or a flower and when he turns it off he makes the flower or the girl sleep
star. It is a very beautiful occupation and because it is beautiful it is
really useful?
